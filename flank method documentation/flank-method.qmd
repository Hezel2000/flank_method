# Introduction
The members of the garnet group have a large variety of chemical compositions with the general formula A^2+^~3~B^3+^~2~(SiO~4~)~3~. A is a distorted octahedral site and B a normal octahedral site. Here we focus on the two garnets almandine and andradite, which differ in their chemical composition and the valence state of Fe. Almandine has the chemical formula Fe^2+^~3~Al~2~(SiO~4~)~3~, with Fe as Fe^2+^ in the distorted octahedral A site, and andradite has the chemical formula Ca~3~Fe^3+^~2~(SiO~4~)~3~, with Fe as Fe^3+^ in the octahedral B site. There is a general, large immiscibility gap between almandine and andradite, however, almandine can have up to ~10% Fe^3+^ and andradite up to ~10% Fe^2+^. This amount is expressed in the atomic ratio Fe^3+^/FeT, with FeT meaning total Fe. The amount of Fe^3+^/FeT can be directly used to calculate the amount of free oxygen, i.e., the oxygen fugacity ($\rightarrow$ fO~2~) while the garnet formed.

# Principle
The energies of the FeL$\alpha$ and FeL$\beta$ lines are close together at 0.7049 and 0.7183 keV, respectively. These energies translate to analyser crystal positions, i.e., L-values on a JEOL microprobe of 191.218 and 187.631 mm. The relative intensities of the lines are 80 and 20, respectively, on a normalised scale of 100. @fig-fe-spectra-alm shows the FeLa and FeLb peaks of an almandine spectra. The vertical lines indicate the tabulated values for FeLa and FeLb. A single tabulated and measured values need not to coincide, as this depends on the mechanical build. The distance of FeLa and FeLb, on the other, should be the same between the tabulated and measured peaks. However, this is not the case as already visible in @fig-fe-spectra-alm by the naked eye.

This means, at least one peak is not where it theoretically should be. The reason is the crystal field in which an atom, in this case the Fe atom, sits. This crystal fields slightly changes the electron energy levels around the Fe atom, and therewith the differences between the electron energy levels. @fig-fe-energy-levels illustrates this effect. The lengths of the arrows represent the energy differences when an electron from a higher shell transitions down to a lower shell, thereby emitting the characteristic X-rays with the same energies as these energy difference. The comparison of the arrow lengths on the right illustrate the change in energy difference between the two characteristic lines La and Lb.

![Schematic comparison of tabulated Fe energy levels with energy levels that are slightly changed by the crystal field.](images/fe-energy-levels.png){#fig-fe-energy-levels width=40%}

These differences define the energies of the characteristic X-rays of the Lb and La lines. This effect is called *chemical peak shift*, and is the fundamental effect, upon which the flank method builds. :red[And finally, this effect also changes the relative intensities of the Lb and La lines.]

Now, the Fe^2+^ in pure almandine occupies the distorted octahedral site, while the Fe^3+^ in pure andradite occupies the normal octahedral site. These two different crystal fields result in slightly different energy levels, and therewith in different energies of the characteristic La and Lb lines and different peak intensities. Hence, almandine and andradite are discriminated by the location and height of their La and Lb peaks. The goal is, however, not to simply discriminate two minerals, Further, most garnets in mantle and metamorphic rocks are solid solutions between almandine and pyrope with the general formula (Mg,Fe)~3~Al~2~(SiO~4~)~3~. These garnets contain, as outlined above, small amounts of Fe^3+^, which is a function of the ambient fO~2~ during garnet formation. But even small variations of Fe^3+^ shift the positions and increase/decrease the intensities of the La and Lb peaks.
We cannot sensibly quantify an entire spectrum such as the one shown in @fig-fe-spectra-alm, and obtaining such spectra would cost way too much time. We therefore position the analyser crystal at a certain L-value, and measure the counts at this position in a standard and then in the sample. Because the peak shifted and in- or decreased its intensity depending on the sample's Fe^3+^/FeT ratio, the counts in the sample will be either lower or higher than in the standard. As these count differences will be small, it is important to move the analyser crystal to a position with maximum count differences between standard and sample. As is seen from the schematic @fig-flank-pos-determination, this position is at around the middle of a peak's flank (now guess how this method earned its name). Each measurement position results in another count difference between the standard and sample peak. Note that *peak* means *somewhere* on the peak, not the peak maximum – which would not possible for both peaks at the same time when the measurement position is fixed, but the peak maximum of the samples is shifted from the peak maximum of the standard.

![Schematic FeL peak in a standard and a sample. The peak of the sample shifted its position and changed its intensity due to a different amount of Fe^3+^/FeT. Three coloured, dashed, vertical measurement positions (Pos) ($\rightarrow$ L-values) are indicated.](images/flank-pos-determination.png){#fig-flank-pos-determination width=40%}

The maximum counts difference between the two spectra can be identified when the counts of spectra, e.g., almandine are subtracted from the counts of the other spectra, which would then be andradite. The positions of the maxima and minima of the resulting *difference spectra* (orange line in @fig-fe-spectra-alm-and) indicate the positions, where the two spectra have their maximum counts differences.

The counts differences between a single, e.g., FeLa standard and sample would insufficiently sensitive to correlate these with Fe^3+^/FeT difference between the standard and the sample. Therefore the counts differences between both, the FeLa and FeLb are determined. To obtain maximum changes in counts, for FeLa the position is chosen, where the difference spectra has its maxima, which will decrease with changing Fe^3+^/FeT, while for FeLb the position is chosen, where the difference spectra has its minima, which will increase with changing Fe^3+^/FeT. The change of counts at these two positions is then expressed by dividing the counts at these two positions, specifically by dividing the counts at the FeLb flank through the counts of the FeLa flank, in short: FeLb/FeLa. This provides a dimensionless number, which is preferable instead of the counts difference, which would be a dimensional number, and depend on measurement conditions. 

The two analyser crystal positions should not be too close to their respective peaks, i.e., good analyser crystal positions in case of @fig-fe-spectra-alm-and would be at 188.07 mm for FeLb and at 190.67 for FeLa, as drawn in the figure by the dashed, grey, vertical lines.

## Summary
Fe^3+^/FeT-poor (e.g., almandine) and Fe^3+^/FeT-rich (andradite) garnets have different chemical peak shifts. The extent of this chemical peak shift is a function of the garnet's Fe^3+^/FeT and FeT. Count rates are measured on the FeLa and FeLb flanks and from these the dimensionless FeLb/FeLa-ratio is calculated. This ratio together with the FeT of a granet is used to determine its Fe^3+^/FeT.

# Application
The FeLb/FeLa of a garnet not only depends on its Fe^3+^/FeT, but also on its Fe-content. @fig-fe-parametrisation-method illustrates this dependency, with the total Fe on the x/ and the FeLb/FeLa ratio on the y-axis. Standards with an ideally wide range of FeT concentrations are therefore imperative. This parametrisation plot and how it is calculated is explained in the next section.

The spread of the iso-Fe^3+^/FeT lines depends on the chosen standards. If only Fe^3+^/FeT-poor garnets are chosen (@fig-fe-parametrisation-alm), the spread is large, and the resolution, i.e., the precision of the Fe^3+^/FeT becomes better. The addition of an andradite standard decreases the spread of the iso-Fe^3+^/FeT lines, and reduces the Fe^3+^/FeT resolution (@fig-fe-parametrisation-alm-and). Finally, the precision of determining the Fe^3+^/FeT becomes increasingly better with increasing FeT, which correlates with a significant increase in the iso-Fe^3+^/FeT lines spread. And vice versa, the lower the FeT in garnet, the more imprecise it becomes to determine its iso-Fe^3+^/FeT.

The FeLb/FeLa ratio depends on the Fe^3+^/FeT and the FeT concentration of a garnet. The blue and orange lines represent lines of the same Fe^3+^/FeT content, with high FeLb/FeLa represent high Fe^3+^/FeT and vice versa. Standards: large, black-rimmed symbols. Samples: small symbols.

# Conclusion
The flank method is an elegant, cost efficient high resolution technique to determine Fe^3+^/FeT, and at the same time the chemical composition of the garnet. It has the potential to be used in a wide range of minerals. The main drawback is the tedious effort to setup the flank method for a new mineral type, which requires a range of minerals with variable FeO-concentrations and known Fe^3+^/FeT, as e.g., determined using Mössbauer quadrupole splitting.


# Alternatives
Alternative methods to determine Fe^3+^/FeT are [Mössbauer spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mössbauer_spectroscopy) or [XANES (X-ray absorption near edge structure)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_absorption_near_edge_structure). Mössbauer spectroscopy has a low resolution in the typical range of tens of µm, while XANES requires a synchrotron and is therefore costly and laborious. These methods can, however, determine Fe^3+^/FeT in basically all types of material.
